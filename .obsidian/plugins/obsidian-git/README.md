# Obsidian Git
Simple plugin that allows you to back up your [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) vault to a remote git repository (e.g. private repo on GitHub).
This plugin assumes credentials are set up.

On advantages of backing up your vault with git I suggest reading this [amazing article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-i-put-my-mind-under-version-control-24caea37b8a5) by [@tallguyjenks](https://github.com/tallguyjenks).
